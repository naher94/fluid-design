    <h2>History of Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>“Developing fixed-size Web pages is a fundamentally flawed practice. Not only does it result in Web pages that remain at a constant size regardless of the user’s browser size, but it fails to take advantage of the medium’s flexibility.”</p>

    <p>The need for responsive design came out of the growing number of devices, where mobile browsing would overtake desktop browsing. Input devices were changing from T9 keypads and mouse and keyboard to touch or game controllers and many more devices were connected to the internet.</p>

      <p>The issue with both of my prototypes is that they only take into consideration screen based interfaces and only screen size rather than more environmental considerations such as touch vs mouse and keyboard. As these prototypes do not take into consideration non-screen based interfaces such as voice, I went back to the drawing board and revisited a typical design process to guide my next steps. Interaction flows as being a good place to start as they are clear in terms of what the user should be doing but are still abstract because they leave out the platform they work on.</p>
